# Entry \#8 - Spiritualism
## 7/21/25

If you told me, 6 months, a year ago, that I now would be a deeply spiritual creature, I would not believe you.

I have historically hated spiritualism. I still kind of do, the organized stuff, anyway. At best I tolerated it. At worst I had outright scorn for that which decided so many of the nonsensical written rules of our world. If you told me then, that I would believe outside of the this. That I would believe in magic. I would be unsettled.

But now, much is different. I am aware I am a dragon. I am aware of the existence of magic, for it must exist in order for me to. I am deeply spiritual. Asking the questions of the soul rather than the mind. Hell, believing in the soul is new for me. I did not think it truly existed. Now, I must. For it does. Of course it does.

Therianthropy is incredibly interesting. It can be many things to the creatures for whom it describes. For me, it is decidedly a belief system. Tools to understand myself and others. To connect with myself and others. To reach paws out in the dark and feel. To understand all that which must be true in order for all of us to be.

This is the unique thing, I think, about this. It is founded on love, rather than fear. Of course, much organized religion positions itself as foundationally about love. If this were true, why would the stick be there along with the carrot? Love is not about punishment. Love is acceptance. Therianthropic spiritualism is unique for those who believe it. None of us share exactly the same beliefs. But we accept this. We accept each other's. There is room for much belief. Even seemingly conflicting belief. Everything is strange, we are strange. Who's to say it is not everything at once?

I have spent time, and learned of times that those I cared about were touched deeply. Quiet moments. Strange objects of power unseen. Items blessed by Luna. I have yet to see, have yet to feel, except in these quiet moments to myself. I will, however. I do. My wings. My tail. My ears. They are there. I feel them. It is deeply spiritual.

Of course, of course. 

Of course it was love that won me over, finally.

Of course.
