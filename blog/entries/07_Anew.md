# Entry \#7 - Anew
## 7/19/25
As I write this, I'm staring out the window of a vehicle driven by my best friend, with some of my closest friends in the other seats. We're coming home from a convention, Eufuria in specific. Three of what will likely end up being the best days of my life, underscored by folks I adore and highlighted by a community I suddenly feel a part of. The girl in front of me is singing. It is wonderful.

I've always struggled with community. I'm really bad at understanding it. I worry about being told that I am "doing it wrong". Probably from all the "you're doing it wrong!" in the younger queer and furry communities. I've also had issue with group size. Big groups give me anxiety, many folks at a time, hard to deem when you *know* someone.

As a result, historically, I have found myself often leaving myself out of larger spaces. Preferring the company of a few, of whom I would often be anxious about expressing myself to. This sucks hard.

Now, I find myself on a precipise. The experiences I've had have left one fundamental afterimage in my mind. That is that this is my place. That I can be this, and I can do this. Much has shifted inside me, reorienting things around new core pieces of myself. That being, my identity as a furry.

It is strange to say that "I did not get it", as someone who has been participating in furry circles for as long as I have. However, I indeed did not get it. As previously stated, it was a tool for expression in small group. This is fine! This of course is fine. Now, I understand it is more. Lots of folks who are at least in some shades, just like me. Enjoying the same things I do, excited about the same things I am. It is a tool to connect. Something that my autistic ass could absolutely use. 

This is wonderful. This is a revelation. I feel like I am home. Hello everyone. I'm Hexaaelia, and I'm here to stay.
