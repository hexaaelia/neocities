# Entry \9 - cloudwatching
## 8/30/25

I wonder what the ratio is, between the happy moments and the sad ones.
If I could lay out every moment start to finish, how would the positive be compared against the negative? Would I be mostly defined by those moments of joy? Or would the sorrow be the majority? What would it say about me? Would it say anything about me, or is it just data without purpose? 
Much has happened in a short time. I have found unabashed joy and indescribable sorrow in extreme proximity. Anxiety, Adoration, desperation and depression. Security and serendipity. The whiplash hurts. But still regardless I think of the positives and smile. A paw in mine. Cool air in my lungs, enough for just a breath.
As I write, the clouds swirl overhead. I watch them with a sort of admiration. A goal never to be reached. It's a sorrowful sensation, to know there's no reaching it. It does, however, always fill my with a peaceful sort of joy. So many happy memories are the small moments I watched the clouds shift between the pain.
Is it true that one defines another? That without pain there would be no solace, and no solace without pain? I am unsure of this. That's a deeply terrifying thought, if you break it down to its core pieces. But it is a useful piece of pragmatism. This too, will pass. The moments you share with those you love, the tears you shed fearing for the little you have left. Soon it will blow away. The memories gone, atomized. The pain a mere scar on the psyche. 
It will never stop. But, please. For just a few fleeting moments, just let me happy. watching the clouds go by.
